 - Admin panel

## Install

 1. Install NPM, Mysql & Brew on your machine (Tutorials can be found at the bottom of the page.)
 2. Fork this repository
 3. git clone https://github.com/bengtbennink/be-assesment-2.git
 4. Install modules
 5. Use Nodemon start to start server

## Additions 05-2019
I have deployed the app via Heroku. It can be found here: [MovieBuddy](https://young-mountain-34305.herokuapp.com/). It was a real struggle to get the app online because several errors popped up inside the Heroku terminal. I've managed to tackle them all with loads of work and some help from [Marijn](https://github.com/Marijnone). Besides that I updated my PackageJSON, added a very big and safe .gitignore and updated the README.md (this file).
